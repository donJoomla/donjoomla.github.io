> Hi, I'm Adam Bouqdib, a front-end developer and Joomla! geek.
> 
> I'm an all-rounder when it comes to web development with well over a decade of experience in PHP &amp; MySQL, JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS and graphic design.  
> I love writing MVC web apps and have a keen eye for usability &amp; web accessibility, coupled with OCD for clean code &amp; web standards and an addiction for new web technologies.
> 
> I have been working with Joomla since 2007 and am an expert at creating custom Joomla components, modules, plugins and templates so I created donjoomla.com as a platform to publish the odd extension I have written inbetween working on larger projects.
