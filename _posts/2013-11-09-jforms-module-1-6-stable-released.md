I'm happy to announce the release of JForms Module 1.6!

### New features include:

#### Google Spreadsheets Plugin
Save the submitted form data straight to a Google Spreadsheet!
#### Your Mailing List Plugin
It is now possible to sign up users to your YMLP mailing list through JForms Module.
#### Data manipulation
The API of JForms Module has been updated to allow plugins to manipulate the data before it gets sent.
#### Name splitting
JForms Module can now split full names into first & last name so the form gets pre-populated correctly with logged in users details.
#### Bootstrap 3
Includes layouts for Bootstrap 3 as well as Bootstrap 2 now.
#### Performance
The module has undergone numerous improvements to optimise performance, including moving all the JavaScript to a separate file and various PHP tweaks
