Wow, I cannot believe it. I've been thinking about making this site for so long I started thinking I was never going to make it. I actually bought the domain nearly 2 years ago but never got round to it as I've always been way too busy with work but I guess all it took was some time off in the Moroccan sun (where I still am right now).  
I know it's still a bit rough round the edges and could do with a lot more content but it's a work in progress and the biggest hurdle is over.

The site may *only* be launching with 3 **Joomla! extensions** but whenever I have the time I will be cleaning up another and uploading it here so you can expect many more as my harddrive is full to bursting with 5 years worth of components, modules & plugins! Of course many of them are outdated by now or cannot be published due to agreements with clients but there's still a fair few that I am sure will be of use and many more I'm currently working on!

To stay up-to-date with my new release why not follow me on Twitter: [@donjoomla](https://twitter.com/donjoomla)

Rather than go rambling on about what else I'm going to do and how smug I feel about it I'm going to get back to work. Stay awesome!
